## Executive Summary

This is a detailed conversation about Sam Parr's journey building Hampton, a peer group for CEOs that reached millions in revenue. The discussion reveals the "idea maze" - all the paths Sam considered but rejected before finding the right business model, target market, and brand positioning. Key insights include:

- **5 failed target markets** before finding product-market fit with CEO founders
- **The research process:** Conducted publicly on podcast with 50-70+ customer interviews
- **Branding investment:** $15,000 for branding agency with clear creative brief
- **Quality over growth:** Rejecting revenue to maintain community quality
- **Founder fit matters:** Building for an audience you understand intimately

---

## Introduction: The Idea Maze

**[00:16 - 01:23]**

The conversation begins with the concept of the "idea maze" - the process entrepreneurs go through when launching a business, wandering through different options and paths before (hopefully) emerging with the right solution.

**Key Question:** What were the other paths Sam considered but said no to along the way? The decisions nobody sees on the cutting room floor:
- Alternative names considered
- Target markets explored
- Value propositions tested
- Branding approaches

---

## Sam's Background and Timeline

**[02:19 - 02:33]**

**Timeline:**
- **2022:** Sold The Hustle newsletter business
- **6-10 months:** Exploration period, testing different business ideas
- **Research Phase:** Publicly interviewed guests running similar businesses on podcast
- **Launch:** Hampton peer group for CEO founders

**Philosophy:** Sam deliberately did his research publicly, having guests on his podcast who ran peer groups, mastermind communities, and similar businesses. He was transparent with them about wanting to launch something similar.

## The Failed Ideas: What Didn't Work

**[02:33 - 07:49]**

### Failed Idea #1: Airbnb / Short-Term Rentals
**[02:36 - 03:27]**

**What Happened:**
- Got "super into Airbnbs" and thought it could work
- Bought one property and tried it out
- Created Facebook group called "SDR Crew" (Short-Term Rental Crew)
- Community members shared blueprints: "I own 40 Airbnbs, here's cash flow, pain points, etc."

**Why It Failed:**
- "This sucks. I do not enjoy this."
- Not in his "zone of genius"
- Pain in the ass operationally
- Good idea on paper, not good idea for him personally

### Failed Idea #2: Trucking Business / Blue Collar Content
**[03:31 - 04:06]**

**What Happened:**
- Wanted to create a trucking business
- Passionate about truckers and blue collar workers (grew up in trucking family)
- Plan: Become a YouTuber, create audience of truckers, then build product for them
- Started doing it

**Why It Failed:**
- "I hate this, not gonna do it"
- Love the IDEA of blue collar workers
- Like getting a neck tattoo - "the idea is kind of neat, but I don't know if I actually want it"

### Failed Idea #3: Marketing Executives
**[05:46 - 06:18]**

**What Happened:**
- Initially tried to target marketing executives, then executives in general
- Did **50-70 meetings** with people trying to convince them to join
- Needed to charge ~$10,000/year to make business viable

**Why It Failed:**
- "No one fucking wanted it"
- People only willing to pay $500
- Created a $500 group - "dude, this sucks, I can't do this"

### Failed Idea #4: Doctors
**[06:21 - 06:30]**

**What Happened:**
- Considered creating peer group for doctors

**Why It Failed:**
- "What the fuck? I don't know anything about doctors"
- Couldn't get in touch with them
- No expertise or network in that space

### Failed Idea #5: Fortune 500 CEOs
**[06:31 - 06:49]**

**What Happened:**
- Considered targeting Fortune 500 CEOs

**Why It Failed:**
- "How do I get in touch with a Fortune 500 CEO? I don't know one."
- Looked great on paper
- Reality punched him in the face

### Failed Idea #6: Minority Entrepreneurs
**[06:51 - 07:49]**

**What Happened:**
- Wife is a minority, heard about challenges she faces
- Thought "I should create this"
- Then looked in the mirror

**Why It Failed:**
- "Yeah, this ain't gonna work"
- "I'm the opposite of a minority"
- Looked great on paper
- No founder fit
- Nickname: "The Vanilla Gorilla"
- "If you Google the word white bread, you're gonna see a picture of Sam Parr"

---

## What is Hampton? The Business Model

**[04:45 - 05:44]**

### The Final Winning Idea: CEO Peer Groups

**Three Core Components:**

#### 1. Small Group Meetings (8-person "therapy groups")
- Similar size or types of companies
- Takes ~6 months to really gel and become awesome
- Members make presentations each meeting:
  - "Here's my portfolio, my net worth - am I doing something right or wrong?"
  - "Here's how my company works - what am I doing wrong/right?"
- Like a therapy group for business

#### 2. Digital Community
- Online forum for posting questions
- Both personal and business topics
- Examples: "I'm trying to hire a nanny - best agencies in the Northeast?"
- Peer advice and recommendations

#### 3. Events
- **200 events per year** at time of recording
- Includes retreats and various gatherings
- Community building and networking

### Inspiration:
Highly inspired by existing companies in the space:
- **Chief** (for women executives)
- **YPO** (Young Presidents' Organization)
- **Vistage** (CEO peer advisory)

### Results:
- Reached **millions of dollars in revenue** very early
- Did NOT use podcast audience initially
- Launched mostly privately
- Built it the right way from the start

---

## Finding the Right Target Market

**[07:49 - 08:32]**

### The Breakthrough

**Partner's Suggestion:** "Dude, let's just go after CEOs"

**Sam's Initial Resistance:** "They will never pay for this"

**What Changed:**
- People had heard rumors he was launching something
- Some people directly asked: "Can you do this for us?"
- He kept saying no
- Finally: "Fuck it, let's do it"
- That was obviously the right decision

### Why CEO Founders Worked

**[08:04 - 08:32]**

**Better Founder Fit:**
- It's who the podcast audience is
- Sam had reputation in that community
- He knew the relatable pain points
- He knew where to reach them (knew where they hang out)
- "It was so much easier. It was way easier."

**Research Validation:**
Interviewed tons of members from other peer groups who said:
- "I'm a tech guy, but my group is all guys who own 18 apartment buildings in South Florida"
- "It kind of sucks. I love them, but we don't align on business"

---

## The Naming Process

**[10:07 - 12:05]**

### How Sam Names His Companies

**System:** All LLCs are named after streets in his neighborhood of St. Louis
- "There's a lot of really good names for some reason"
- Process: Look at map of where he's from, look at the names

### Names Considered (Runner-Ups):

1. **Maclin** - "I love that name" (thought about "Maclin Running Club")
2. **Sibleb** - "I've always liked Sibleb"
3. **Simpson** - Street he grew up near
4. **Kings Highway** - "I love Kings Highway"

### The Winner: Hampton

**Origin:** Named after Hampton Avenue in St. Louis (where he grew up)

**Common Misconception:** Most people think it means "The Hamptons" (fancy area in New York)
- Sam didn't even know what The Hamptons were until age 27
- Thought it was from The Great Gatsby
- Learned about it when he married someone from that area

**Name Selection Process:**
- Only asks **3 people** (actually 2): wife and business partner
- "I don't really ask too many people because I just don't care that much"
- Wants to hear gut opinions

**Domain:** Hampton.com owned by Marriott (Hampton Inn hotels) - probably won't get it

---

## Branding Strategy: Elite but Cheeky

**[12:05 - 14:12]**

### The Branding Investment

**Cost:** $15,000 for branding agency (right out the gate)

**Sam's Evolution:** "If you asked me 5-10 years ago, I'd never in a million years thought this was important, but I actually do."

### The Creative Brief

Created a document with **one line:**

> **"Elite but cheeky"**

### Inspiration: Felix Dennis

**Who:** Famous entrepreneur (now deceased), creator of Maxim magazine
- Combination of Richard Branson and Mick Jagger
- Had swagger but was legit business guy
- Elite at what he does, but silly person
- Wrote in very conversational way

**Book Reference:** "How to Get Rich" by Felix Dennis

### The Brand Document Contents

**1. Business Basics:**
- What the business is
- Who uses it

**2. Advertisement Examples:**
Collected tons of ads Sam liked:
- Focus on **1970s advertisements** (favorite era)
- **GQ ads**
- **Porsche ads**
- **Rolex ads**

**Key Example: Rolex Campaign**
- Series called **"The Men Who Built the World Wear Rolex"**
- Cool exposés on astronauts, Dwight Eisenhower (President)
- "The men who build America are wearing a Rolex"

**Wall Street Journal Ad:**
- "Money talks, we translate"
- Beautiful imagery

**3. Color Selection: British Racing Green**

**What It Is:**
- Famous color from Land Rover, Range Rover, Jaguar
- British racing colors
- Sam's favorite color
- Has motorcycles and cars in that color

**Brand Direction to Agency:**
"We have to make the brand feel like these ads, but be that color"

**4. Website Copy:**
Wrote specific sentences he wanted on the website

**Conclusion:** "Hiring a branding agency is like a total hack"

## What They Said No To

**[14:12 - 17:18]**

### Big Decision #1: Watching Every Interview

**The Situation:**
- Hampton receives **~100 applications per day**
- They accept only a fraction
- To get into Hampton, you must interview

**What They Said NO To: Delegating This**
- Sam and partner Joe watch **100% of interviews**
- They are the **only people** who click approve/deny
- "That is our job - to watch 100% of the interviews"

**The Cost:**
- Turning down huge amounts of revenue
- "It fucking kills me. I'm adding up the numbers."

**Comparison: Chief.com**
- Grew to **$100M revenue in 4-5 years**
- How? They **let in 100% of people** who apply and interview
- Hampton doesn't do this

**The Temptation:**
- "I see all this missed revenue. Oh my God."
- Mental exercise: "What's the charcoal I could make from these people we've rejected?"
  - Reference: Kingsford charcoal invented because Ford had extra wood from furnaces

### Big Decision #2: Staying Focused

**What They Said NO To:**
- Creating products for rejected applicants
- Expanding to other demographics
- Multiple product lines

**What They Said YES To:**
"We're only focusing on CEOs of this demographic, of this type of business. And we're only going to do that until we say otherwise. And there's no time in the near future that we intend to say otherwise."

## Advice and Lessons Learned

**[16:18 - 20:16]**

### Advice Sam Received (and is implementing)

#### 1. Showcase the Curation Process
**[16:25 - 17:01]**

**The Problem:** Hampton's website doesn't clearly show how selective they are

**The Solution:**
- Show that you say no to many people
- Highlight how heavy the curation is
- "The founders watch every single interview"
- "They accept less than 1% of people"
- Have a counter showing:
  - How many people they've said no to
  - How much revenue they've turned down
- Message: "We put our money where our mouth is - we turned down this much revenue to keep quality high"

**Why It Works:** Makes people want to join MORE because it proves community quality

#### 2. Balance Elite with Cheeky
**[17:04 - 17:11]**

"You got the elite part right, now we have to make it cheeky"
- "I just went too elite douchey"
- Need to work on the other part of the brand promise

#### 3. Use the Founding Story
**[17:14 - 20:16]**

**Sam's Mistake:** Wanted to make it NOT "the Sam Parr business"
- "I think I screwed up. I think I should have leaned into that."

**The Strategy:**
- Founder CAN be the face for a period of time, then phase it out
- Did this successfully with The Hustle

**When Founder as Face DOESN'T Work:**
- When founder has to deliver the service
- Example: Law firm, marketing agency
- "I want THAT guy on my account"

**Why It DOES Work for Hampton:**
- Sam doesn't deliver the actual service
- He's not the account manager
- The peer group is the service

**The True Founding Story:**

The origin of Hampton IS Sam's own experience:
- Created peer group in San Francisco when running companies
- "We didn't know shit"
- Out of that group came:
  - A **billion dollar company**
  - A **$100 million company**
  - A **$30 million company**
  - Two failures
  - Best man at Sam's wedding
  - Friend who became investor
  - **This podcast** (My First Million)

**The Peer Group Process in Action:**
- "I'm going to do The Hustle - it's an events business"
- Next month: "No, it's not events, it's a blog business"
- Feedback from peer group: "You're showing up to a knife fight with a knife. You need a magic fucking wand."
- Sam's realization: "I'm not trying to build a billion dollar company. I'm trying to build a company that makes me X millions of dollars. That would change my life and be fucking awesome."

**The Value:** First-hand experience of how peer groups helped build successful businesses

## Additional Insights

### On Branding Agencies
**[20:16 - 21:28]**

**The Trade-off:**
- Feels indulgent when you have zero revenue
- "Now I'm going to take a break to do mood boarding and talk about how the brand needs to feel?"
- Internal voice: "Shut up, you idiot. Go build your business."

**Smart Approach (Milk Road Strategy):**
- Wanted to do brand right away
- Made it a reward: "When we get to 100,000 subscribers, we'll do the brand"
- "We can always rebrand and polish it up"

**When It's Worth It:**
- If confident about the idea
- It's a luxury item, not necessity
- **Exception: E-commerce brands** - "You've got to get your brand right"

### On Naming Agencies
**[21:28 - 25:56]**

**Sam's Experience:** Paid **$25,000** for naming agency

**What He Learned:**

#### The Good:
1. **The People Are Awesome**
   - Someone drawn to naming is super interesting
   - Actually should hire them away: "You're gonna run our whole brand. Come in-house."

2. **The Process Was Valuable**
   - Three people came in (maybe too many)
   - Asked deep questions: "What IS it?" (not just surface description)
   - Most pressure Sam ever felt in a pitch
   - Needed to capture the essence, not corporate BS

3. **The Creative Exercise** (MOST VALUABLE)
   - Guy moved table aside
   - Sat on floor with whiteboard
   - Wrote long sentences (not names - paragraphs!)
   - **First-person venting as the customer**

   Example (for dating app):
   > "I don't download a dating app. I download dating apps. All of them. Every single one. It's embarrassing. I've tried them all, use them all, hate them all. But I use them. I hate to use them. It's mostly me sending messages that aren't getting replies. The next message I send, I know probably won't get a reply. That's a pretty hopeless feeling. At least if I go to a girl at a bar, she rejects me to my face. Online? Cowards. These women are cowards."

   - Scratching stuff out: "No, that's not really true"
   - Like slam poetry
   - Getting to FEELING of problem and solution
   - Not in business plan format

   **Sam:** "I paid a very expensive $25K to learn that one process, which is actually very useful as a copywriter to get to the essence of what you're trying to do."

#### The Bad:
- Did exercises with flashcards
  - "Branson, Elon Musk, Einstein - pick two that fit"
  - "Corvette, Rolex, Louis Vuitton - pick two"
- Sam: "What is this, a personality quiz?"
- Hated the whole process
- **The name ended up sucking**
- Sam doesn't even remember what it was
- App failed by the time they delivered the name

**Conclusion:** Still thinks it's worth it, despite the high cost

## Key Takeaways

**[25:56 - 27:10]**

### 1. Do Your Research in Public
- Sam had guests on podcast who ran similar businesses
- Got the blueprint directly from them
- Was transparent about his intentions
- Created public paper trail

### 2. Expect Multiple False Starts (5 Failed Target Markets)
**The Process:**
1. Had an idea that sounded good in theory
2. Tried to contact potential customers
3. Asked: "Do you want this?"
4. Got punched in the face
5. Repeated 5 times

**The Pattern:**
- Ideas that looked great on paper failed in reality
- Some had no founder fit (minority entrepreneurs)
- Some he couldn't reach (Fortune 500 CEOs)
- Some he hated doing (Airbnb, trucking)
- Settled on what was probably the obvious idea (CEO founders)

### 3. Naming Can Be Simple
- Used streets from his neighborhood
- Asked only 2-3 people for feedback
- Went with gut feeling
- Hampton just "had a good sound to it"

### 4. Branding Brief Is Critical
**Garbage In, Garbage Out:**
- What you give the agency matters more than the agency itself
- Sam created specific document with:
  - One-line positioning: "Elite but cheeky"
  - Visual references (ads from 70s, Rolex, GQ)
  - Color palette (British racing green)
  - Sample copy he wanted
- This direction led to good output

### 5. Founder Story Is Powerful
- Be willing to be the face initially
- You can phase out later
- Only works if you're not delivering the service yourself
- Sam's peer group experience IS the founding story
- Shows proof of concept and genuine understanding

### 6. Quality Over Growth
- Watching every interview personally
- Turning down revenue to maintain standards
- Staying focused on one demographic
- Resisting temptation to expand too soon

### 7. Founder Fit Matters Most
- Build for audience you understand
- Build where you have reputation
- Build where you know the pain points
- Build where you know how to reach people
- "It was so much easier. It was way easier."
