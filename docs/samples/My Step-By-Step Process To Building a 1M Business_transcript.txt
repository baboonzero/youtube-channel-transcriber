--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm like, I should create this. And then I looked in the mirror and I was like, yeah, this ain't gonna work. There's a reason your nickname is the vanilla gorilla. Okay, like, you're like, they're one gonna work. So Sam, I got a question for you. You have launched this business this year called Hampton. And I love the name. I love the brand. I go to the website. I love the website. More than anything, I love the idea. I'm jealous of this idea. Andrew Wilkinson said, I'm so jealous that I didn't start this idea. We are, I feel like you got so much right. And I know that in doing any idea, whatever you, there's something called the idea maze. You go through, you wander around, you try to figure out the right path. And if you're lucky, you pop out the other side with what you did with Hampton where everything turned out right. What I wanna know is, what were the other paths you considered, but ended up saying no to along the way. Because nobody sees that stuff. That's on the cutting room floor. I wanna know, I love the name Hampton. Were there other names that you thought about? And like, how did you pick that one? And like, what was that decision process? I wanna know target market. Like, I feel like you nailed the target market. You've nailed the value prop. Were there three other runner-ups that you consider that you didn't have? I kinda wanna see what goes on underneath the surface before this beautiful execution comes out. Well, first, thanks. You hopefully only see the good stuff. Obviously, there's all types of bad shit that happens on the backend where we're like, the sucks, but in general, it's been quite pleasant. So, dude, with this company, it's so funny. I purposely had on, we had guests that ran these types of companies. And I wanted to prove to everyone, I'm gonna do my research in front of people. You left a paper trail, right? Like, you left public breadcrumbs as to exactly how you did this step by step. And by the way, I love that you're honest about this because you definitely had guests come on and basically explain to you what the blueprint is. And then you were like, cool, thanks. Gonna go execute on that blueprint. And I didn't hide it from them. I told them, I told them before and after, I wanna launch, I wanna launch, I'm thinking of launching something like this and let's talk about it. So, there was nothing unethical or evil about this, but yeah, I wanted to do it publicly so people could see. So, let me tell you first. So, I sold the hustle, I think in 22, yeah. And, or something like that. And I had about six months or eight months or 10 months I forget where I was just kind of fooling around and I was looking at different ideas. The two ideas that lost, I'm so thankful they lost. One, remember how I got super into Airbnb's? I was like, this is the thing, I could do this. So, I bought one and I did it. And I did okay, but I was like, this sucks. I do not enjoy this. This is it in my zone of genius. It's a pain in the ass. And it seems on paper like a good idea. You had a, you created this Facebook group of, I forgot what you called it, like Sam's short term rental bros or whatever the hell you call it. It was an SDR crew, the SDR crew, short term rental crew. And people piled in and they started explaining their blueprint to like, yo, I own 40 Airbnb's. They make this much cash flow. Here's the pain points, here's the plus sides. This other guy's like, oh, I do the same thing with this angle. And I was like, dude, this is fascinating. Sam's doing his research again in public. And if you were wandering around the IDMAs, you're like, maybe it's over here. Maybe the exit path is over here in this short term rental thing. And it kind of seemed like a good idea on paper, but you ended up saying no to that. And it was a good idea. It wasn't a good idea for me. It is a profitable thing, whatever. It was cool. The second thing that I thought about doing was, I thought about creating, I've always wanted to create a trucking business. I'm passionate about truckers. I'm passionate about blue collar workers. My family, I grew up in a trucking family. So I'm like, they're working that industry. And so I was like, I'm gonna become a YouTuber and I'm gonna create an audience of truckers. And then I'm gonna build a product for them. And then I started doing it and I was like, now, hate this, not gonna do it. You're like, I love the idea of blue collar workers. Yeah. I like the idea of it being a monk's dad. Yeah. Yeah, it's like getting a neck tattoo. It's like the idea of it's kind of neat, but I don't know if I actually want it. And so then I was like, look, we had this thing called Trends at the hustle and I got a lot wrong. And I love the business model still. I think I can do this. And my partner, my now business partner, we had like basically a therapy group where we would like bitching to play about everything going on. And we're like, I settled on that product. You built a product, launched it, did not use your audience initially publicly. You didn't use the podcast to promote it initially. Maybe your brand name helped, partly private, but you didn't do it publicly. And you drove it to millions of dollars in revenue very early on. So very successful thing that everybody lists his podcast kind of wants that outcome. So you know, you're a walking case study. Go ahead. Yeah. So Hampton is a peer group. So some people call it a community. I call it a peer group. Basically there's three parts of the peer group. So you have an eight person group that have similar size or types of companies. And you basically, it's like a therapy group. You just complain. So it takes about six months to really like forward to like catch and be awesome. But I have a six person or eight person group. It's freaking awesome. And you will do everything like you. Someone will make a presentation for every meeting and they'll say like, here's my portfolio. Here's my net worth. Can you guys tell me am I doing something or am I doing something right? Here's how my company works. What am I doing wrong? What am I doing right? And so they do a presentation. So that's part one. Part two is we have a digital community where you can like post in there and see what other people are saying. And you'd like, hey, I'm trying to hire Nanny. What are your guys' best advice for agencies to use in the Northeast? Things like that. You can do personal stuff, non-personal stuff. The third thing is events. I think we host 200 events a year at this point, including retreats, all these types of things. So it's highly inspired by chief, YPO, Vistage, these are large companies that are in the space. So that's the business. Originally, I was trying to go after marketing executives and then just executives in general. Dude, I called, I did 50 to 70 meetings with people trying to convince them to join. And none of them wanted it. Hello, dear marketing executive. Yeah, anyway. So it goes your marketing today. No one fucking wanted it. I couldn't get it. And then eventually I was like, I need to charge around 10 grand a year in order to make this a viable business. No one fucking wanted it. They're willing to pay $500. And I created a group that was actually $500. And I was like, dude, this sucks. I can't do this. And then we were like, should we do doctors? Doctors would be cool. But what the fuck? I don't know anything about doctors. I try to get in touch with the sun and no one wanted it. And then I was like, Fortune 500 CEOs. Same problem. How do I get in touch with the Fortune 500 CEO? Like I don't know one. Like it is really hard. And then I did it with the salary on the paper. But as soon as they came into contact with reality, they got punched in the face. And they ran out the nose. They got punched in the face. Well, this one really punched me in the face. The next one we thought about minorities. We're like, my wife is a minority. And I hear a little bit of the things that she goes through. I'm like, I should create this. And then I looked in the mirror. And I was like, yeah, this ain't gonna work. I'm the opposite of a minority. This is my look great on paper. But yeah, the old reflection. It doesn't look in the mirror. Yeah. I remember when you told me that idea. And I was like, dude, honestly, it's a great idea. I think it's a underserved community. I think they want that career development. I think that makes sense. But I was like, dude, what are you gonna do when you're like, hey, I was like, you know, are you gonna have Sarah be the CEO? Like, what are you gonna do? You're gonna be like, I am this white man who is running this guy back. I don't know, you're possible. But like, I don't know. If you Google the word white bread, you're gonna see a picture of Sam Parr. Like it would not have worked. There's a reason your nickname is the vanilla gorilla. Okay. Like, one gonna work. And then my partner was like, dude, let's just go out to CEO. So he'd been saying this whole time. I'm like, they will never pay for this. But all along, some people had heard rumors that I was launching this. So they asked me, like, can you do this for us? And I kept saying no. And then finally, we were like, fuck it. Let's do it. And then that obviously was the right decision. But by the way, I did a ton of research. So I interviewed a ton of members of all these different groups. And they're like, I'm a tech guy, but it's all like guys who own like 18 apartment buildings in South Florida in my group. It kind of sucks. I love them, but we don't like a line on business. Well, it just sounds like it's better founder fit, right? Like, yo, it's a true war. Yeah, no, no, no. It's who our audience is on this podcast. It's where you had a reputation. It's where you knew the relatable pain points. It's you knew how to, you knew where to reach him because you knew where you hang out. It's like way better founder fit. It was so much easier. It was way easier. All right, everyone, a quick break to tell you about HubSpot. And this one's really easy for me to talk about because I'm going to show you a real life example. So I've got this company called Hampton. Join Hampton.com. It's a community for founders doing between two million all the way up to like $250 million a year in revenue. And one of the ways that we've grown is we've created these cool surveys. And so we have a lot of founders who have high net worth. And we'll ask them all types of questions that people typically are embarrassed to ask, but provide a lot of value. So things like how much the founders paid themselves each month, how much money they're spending each month, what their payroll looks like. If they're optimistic about the next year and their business, all these questions that people are afraid to ask, but well, we ask them anyway. And they tell us in this anonymous survey. And so what we do is we created a landing page using HubSpot's landing page tool. And it basically has a landing page that says, here's all the questions we asked. Give us your email if you want to access it. And then I shared this page on Twitter. And we were able to get thousands of people who gave us their email and told us they want this survey. And I could see, did they come from social media? I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn. It basically everywhere else that they could possibly come from, I'm able to track all of that. And then I'm able to see over the next handful of the weeks, how many of those people actually signed up and became a member of Hampton. In other words, I can see how much revenue came from this survey, how much revenue came from each traffic source, things like that. But the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it. And a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen. HubSpot made that super, super easy. If you're interested in doing this, you can check it out hubspot.com, the links in the description. And I'll also put the link to the survey that I did so you can actually see the landing page and how it worked and everything like that. I'm just going to do that call to action then. And it's free. Check it out in the description. All right, now back to MFM. Now let's talk about the names. Here's a good story about the names. So the company's called Hampton. A lot of people think that means the Hamptons. Up until I was like 27, I didn't know what the Hamptons were. I thought I had read about it and like the great Gatsby. I thought like it was like that. I didn't even know what it was until I married a woman from that area and I learned about it. So what I do is all of my LLCs are named after streets in my neighborhood of St. Louis. And there's a lot of really good names for some reason. And so I just usually look at the map of where I'm from and I just look at the names. So let me tell you some names that I thought about naming it. None of these really fit, but they could fit for other things. Number one is Maclin. I love that name. Maclin. So at one point I thought about having the Maclin running club. The second one is Sibleb. I've always liked Sibleb. The third one was Simpson. That was a street I grew up near. And then the last one, check this out. Kings Highway. This Kings Highway also, I love Kings Highway. I love Kings Highway. And then eventually we settle about Hampton because I grew up near Hampton Avenue and everyone thinks that it means the Hamptons. It doesn't. It means Hampton. And so sometimes people will say like, oh, I love the Hamptons referring to my company and I'm like, no, it's Hampton. So we settled on Hampton because I had a good sound to it. By the way, can you tell me in deciding a name, is that like a one day process, a one hour process, a one month process for you and are you bouncing it off people or are you just going into a dark room and saying what feels right in my soul? Like what's your, what is the actual way a name gets picked for you? I only ask like three people. Usually it's my wife, my business partner, and that's about it. Three people, but actually there's only two. Even better. Did I just name two? In myself. The Royale Wii. Yeah. No, I don't really ask too many people because I just don't care that much. Like I just want to like hear someone's gut opinion. But and also hampton.com, I don't think I'm ever going to get. You know who it owns that is Mary-O. Yeah, the Hampton and yeah. So I don't know if I'm ever going to get that, but check this out with branding. If you asked me about this five or 10 years ago, I'd never have a million years thought this was important, but I actually do. I hired a branding agency. So I paid $15,000 right out the gate and what I did was and I sent this to you, I created this document and it says, it just says one line. It says elite but cheeky. And the reason I was inspired by that was, have you read Felix Dennis' book? Yes. How to get rich. So Felix Dennis is this famous entrepreneur. He's dead now, but he was a wild guy. He was basically a combination of Richard Branson and Mick Jagger. So he had like swagger, but he was like a legit business guy. But he was like, he was like elite in that. He was great at what he does, but he was like a silly person and he wrote in a very conversational way. And I love that. And so when I wrote out this branding document, I listed what the business is, who uses it, whatever. And then what I did was I listed a ton of ads that I liked. So there's a bunch of advertisements from the 70s. That's one of my favorite errors for ads. And I found a bunch of GQ ads, Porsche ads, and Rolex ads. Like Rolex had this famous series of ads called The Men Who Built the World Wear Rolex. And they would do like a really cool expose on like an astronaut. And you can see they asked you not he's wearing a Rolex or Dwight Eisenhower, the president of the United States. He's got a Rolex and it's the men who build America are wearing a Rolex. And then there's one with a Wall Street Journal where it says, money talks, we translate. And it's just this beautiful imagery. And so I took that imagery and then I took the color British racing green. You know what British racing green is? I mean, it's the Hampton colors, but it's like a famous color from like Land Rover and Jaguar. It's like these British racing colors that I love. And I thought that because like when I think of a Land Rover or Range Rover or Jaguar, what do you got there? There you go. That's almost so I freaking love that color. That's my favorite color. I've got motorcycles and that color. I've had a car in that color. It's my favorite color. And I took that color and I'm like, we have to make the brand feel like these ads, but be that color. And I wrote a bunch of sentences that I would want on the website. And that's how we selected the branding. And dude, hiring a branding agency is like a total hack. What are some things along the way of making Hampton that you could have done, but you said no to. And in retrospect, maybe it's a good idea about it. You don't know. You don't know how it would have turned out. But like, what were the nose up? Because we can only see what you said yes to. We could see the name you chose. We did you told us what the name you said no to? We could see the color you chose. What were the things you said no to along the way? Was there anything else that was like a pack you considered? Here's two really big ones. So Hampton gets, let's just say, these aren't the exact numbers, but we'll use them roughly 100 people a day who apply. We accept a fraction of that. And my partner, Joe and I, we watch, so in order to get into Hampton, you have to interview. We watch 100% of the interviews. And we are the only people who click a prover deny. That is it. It was us too. That is our job is to watch 100% of the interviews. So you said no to delegating that out? We said no to delegating that out. And we also, here's what sucks. Did we turn down so many people? And it's like we're turning down so much revenue. And it fucking kills me. I'm like adding up the numbers. When I, now when you ask me, so chief, cheap.com, it's like this business, I guess we're like them, but therefore women executives, you know why they grew so fast? They grew to 100 million in revenue in four or five years. They led in 100% of the people who apply in interview. We don't. And it fucking kills me. I see all this misrevenue. And I'm like, oh my God. And so I'm picking in my head. I'm like, so a lot of people, we've talked about those, but Kingsford charcoal was invented because Ford had all this extra wood that they used to like their furnaces and they eventually turn it to charcoal. That's how Kingsford charcoal came about. And so always in my head, I'm like, what's the charcoal I could make from these people who we've rejected? Or who don't fit our criteria at the moment? And but we've said no to doing any of those ideas. And so we're all what we said basically, we're only focusing on CEOs of this demographic, of this type of business. And we're only going to do that until we say otherwise. And there's no time in the near future that we intend to say otherwise. Well, let me tell you two things I think you could be doing. So can we give you two ideas? I think you maybe should have said yes to you. Number one, I think if I go to your website right now, I don't see that you say no to that many people or that there's a cure that how heavy the curation is. All the things you just said to me would make me want to join because it's like, oh, they're really actually curing the community. These are actually high quality people. The founders watch every single interview they let they accept it less than 1% of people. They have a counter on their website of how many people they've said no to or how many how much revenue they've said no to in order to make the community solid because that comes first. And we put our money where our mouth is, we turned down this much revenue. And maybe it's too vulgar, but I think you could use that. The second thing, you got the elite part right now, now we have to make it cheeky. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I just went to the lead douchey. So I don't know, we got to work on the other part. The other thing I don't think you did a great job of is your story. So like, do you value a founding story in like the founder story and the founding story of the company? Do you think that's important or useful? I think that's incredibly important. And I think I made a mistake because I wanted to make this not the Sam par business. And I think I screwed up. I think I should have leaned into that. I think the way it works, I did this with the hustle. You can, the founder can be the company or be the face for a period of time and you could phase it out. And with this time, I was like, I'm not going to be it. And I screwed that up. Yeah, yeah. I think you should lean into that because the, the, the situation is where you don't want the founder to be the, the, the face and the reason to join is when the founder has to deliver the service. It's like the law firm or the, the specialty, you know, marketing exec. It's like, oh, this guy's great. But oh, now I'm handed off to some junior person they're doing my marketing. I want that guy on my account. Whereas with this, you don't have to be the account. You know, you're not delivering the actual service. So I think you could use it because the true founding story is that's how we met. We made a peer group in San Francisco when we didn't know shit, when we were running our companies and there was, and it was a failure succeed. And in that group came a billion dollar company, a hundred million dollar company, a $30 million company, a two failures, but one best man at your wedding and a friend who ended up investing in their thing and that came out of that. And then this podcast came out of that, which then has become one of the top business podcasts, but what? Like that's actually almost like your founding story as an entrepreneur and helped you when you actually sold the hustle successfully. So from, I remember in our peer groups, it was like, I'm going to do the hustle. It was an events business. Then, no, no, next month, there was not an events business. It's a blog business. You said something that stuck with me and it was, it pissed you off. No, no, because you weren't wrong. You were right in that I couldn't build a huge company that way, but you were wrong in that I don't have to build a huge company in order to achieve my goals, which was you go, dude, you're showing up to this fight, you're showing up to this knife fight, which is a knife. I don't even want you to have a gun. You need to have a magic fucking wand. And I was like, well, you're not wrong. That would be nice to have that, but I don't. And so until that, we're used in our fists. And Silicon Valley, if you go pitch for investors, you're basically making a promise that it's going to be a billion dollar company. So I was like, I don't think it's going to be a billion dollar company. What I didn't know is you were like, I'm not trying to build a billion dollar company. I'm trying to build a company that makes me X millions of dollars and like, and I can do it. It can actually do that. And that would change my life and be fucking awesome, which is a different pitch. So you are right, but where I was wrong was, I shouldn't have aimed for that from the get go, but you are correct. But so I think maybe using a founding story would be helpful for you because it's genuine. That's actually the origin of I think a lot of this is like first hand experience, how the peer group helped you and how blah, blah. And then how it also leads to all these other thing that group became, you know, one guy's like, you know, a groom's miniature wedding, another guy becomes an investment. You make down the road, blah, blah, blah. That's kind of how these tend to work. So anyways, that's my two sets. Well, thank you. Did you have you ever used a braining agency? Have I used a guy for the milk road? Not I mean, he's an agency, but it's like a guy, one guy. Which I think you actually nailed. I think you nailed that to be honest. Yeah, I loved it. It was a cool experience. It definitely felt so indulgent. It's like, oh, and now I'm going to take a break from my zero revenue business to go through this mood boarding process with this designer and talk about how the brand needs to feel. It's like, it needs to feel like there's a user and a customer. And there's definitely a part of my voice that was like, shut up, shut up, you idiot. You go, go build your business. But what we did, the trade off we did was we actually with milk road, we wanted to do a brand right away. And we said, let's reward ourselves with a brand when we get to, I think we said 100,000 subscribers on the on the list. And I said, today we're going to make the brand. And but when we get to 100,000, then we'll know like this is, we can always rebrand and we can, we can polish it up. That's what we did to reward ourselves. I think in the future, I would probably use an agency if I'm confident about the idea. If I, it's also just like, I don't know, it's a luxury item. It's not a necessity, but it's a luxury. I think for something, it is a necessity. Like if you're a e-commerce brand or something, you've got to get your brand right. And you know another thing that I thought was a dumbest thing ever, but I think could be cool, a naming agency. I use the naming agency once. I find a lot of value in that now. I think that it's like most agencies where a lot will suck, but I actually think that could be quite valuable. What naming, how much is the naming agency? I hired it because this is one of my many rookie mistakes. I hired a naming agency once. I paid them $25,000. A lot of money. And they came in now. Let me tell you a couple of things about them. That's interesting. One, the people who work in a naming agency are actually awesome. Somebody who is drawn to that is a super interesting person. And actually the move is to go vet brand gategesys, or naming gategesys, and then just pluck the most interesting person you have. And be like, you're gonna run our whole brand. Come over, you just come in, house, you're gonna run our brand. That's what I should have done. And just the audacity that they think that they can just name something. They think that could be the job. Who do you think you are? It's like, that's pretty. So they come in and there's three of them. I don't know if it takes three. So this is my God. And so they three of them come in and they sit down and they say, so tell me about the company. And when I tell you I've never felt as much pressure in a pitch, because I'm like, this isn't pitching for an investor or a customer. I'm like, I need to give these creatives, because creative people like that, they're very skeptical. You know, they see a bunch of corporate BS. It's like, I need to be cool and so clear. And I need to capture the essence inside this business. I can't just say the surface line. That's what they want. They were like, yeah, but what is it? And you're like, I just told you what it is. What do you mean, what is it? So anyways, I have this conversation with them. And then I'm like, I want to know this guy's process. And so I leave the room. He comes, I come back in. Mox amongst the weeds. He needs to read us. In the middle of the room, he's moved our table to the side. He's sitting in his cell with a floor. With a wipe, took our whiteboard, put it on the ground. And he's writing long sentences. And I'm like, this is not names. Like this is like paragraphs. What are you doing? And he's just writing out almost in first person. This was awesome. He's writing out in first person. I think we were doing a dating app at the time. So he was helping us with a dating app. He was just writing out like from first person almost venting as the customer. And he's like, I don't download a dating app. I download dating apps. All of them. Every single one of them. It's embarrassing. And he's like, I've tried them all. I use them all and I hate them all. But I use them. I hate to use them. And he's like, I hate them because it's mostly me sitting there sending out messages that are not getting replies. And I just, and then the next message I said, I know this is probably not going to reply. That's a pretty hopeless feeling. At least if I go to a girl at a bar, she rejects me to my face. Online cowards. These women are cowards. And he's like, they don't even apply. And so then he's just venting. And he's like, and he's scratching stuff out. Because he's like, no, that's not really true. But it was almost like slam poetry. It's like, he was trying to like, almost get into the feeling of the problem and then the solution. And he was, but he was doing it not in a business plan anyway. But I really actually liked that process. And I kind of hijacked that. So I paid a very expensive 25k to learn that one process, which is actually very useful as a copywriter to, to like get to the essence of like, what you're trying to do. The name ended up sucking. And like they did all these exercises where they would be like, they put out these flashcards that were like, Branson, Elon Musk, Einstein. They're like, pick, pick two that you think fit. And then they'd be like, Corvette Rolex, Louis Vuitton, blah, blah, pick two. And then I'm like, dude, what is this personality quiz? And I was just like, I hated the whole process. And then whatever the name was whatever it was. I don't even remember how to say the name. I don't even remember the name. I'm sorry, it's very unsatisfying ending to it. But how do you not remember the name that they picked? That's say, lovey. That's what you should've called the fucking app. The app like failed by the time they gave us the name. We were like, this is a stupid idea. We don't know how to do this. App, let's move on. I still think it's worth it, by the way. I still think it's worth it. I think that's a lot of money though. 25 grand is a lot. I think I paid my branding agency 15,000. Yeah, it's hard. When you, when she start to fall into that hole, you're like, well, do I want the best brand or just a mediocre brand? Like how much of my brand gonna be worth? Is it not worth an extra 5K? It's very hard to say no. Dude, at least for me. That's ridiculous. Is that the pod? Well, let's let's recap real quick. It took you, you did your research in public. It took you five false starts on figure out who is the customer and the way you did it was, you had an idea that sounded good in theory and then you went and tried to contact them and be like, do you want this? And then you got like punch to the face five times. And then one of them looked great, but then like no founder fit. And you settled on what was probably the obvious idea. So that's like the first takeaway. Second takeaway, your name is awesome. The name is awesome, but you use streets around you. Okay, I don't know if anyone else wants to copy that. Mine would be a grand floral boulevard, which I don't think is gonna make for a great startup name. No, San Francisco has a bunch of good names too. Well, that's why I used to live another kid. I think we should show the deck that you made for the branding agency. Because this is not what they gave you. This is what you gave them to get a good output. Because you garbage in, garbage out. If you give the bad instructions or bad prompt, you're gonna get a bad result on the brand. So I think that's cool to show. And I think maybe one other thing that I think people could take away is using a founder story. I think a founder story is very powerful. And I think I need to fix that. So I just got like $25,000 worth of advice for free. So that's good. I appreciate that. You got my Ben-Mont. All right, is that it? Is that the pod? That's it, that's the pod. What's up? What's up? What's up? What's up?




DETAILED TRANSCRIPT WITH TIMESTAMPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[00:00] I'm like, I should create this.
[00:00] And then I looked in the mirror and I was like,
[00:02] yeah, this ain't gonna work.
[00:04] There's a reason your nickname is the vanilla gorilla.
[00:06] Okay, like,
[00:06] you're like,
[00:08] they're one gonna work.
[00:16] So Sam, I got a question for you.
[00:18] You have launched this business this year called Hampton.
[00:21] And I love the name.
[00:23] I love the brand.
[00:24] I go to the website.
[00:24] I love the website.
[00:26] More than anything, I love the idea.
[00:29] I'm jealous of this idea.
[00:30] Andrew Wilkinson said,
[00:31] I'm so jealous that I didn't start this idea.
[00:34] We are, I feel like you got so much right.
[00:37] And I know that in doing any idea,
[00:41] whatever you,
[00:42] there's something called the idea maze.
[00:43] You go through, you wander around,
[00:45] you try to figure out the right path.
[00:46] And if you're lucky,
[00:47] you pop out the other side with what you did with Hampton
[00:49] where everything turned out right.
[00:51] What I wanna know is,
[00:53] what were the other paths you considered,
[00:55] but ended up saying no to along the way.
[00:58] Because nobody sees that stuff.
[00:59] That's on the cutting room floor.
[01:01] I wanna know, I love the name Hampton.
[01:03] Were there other names that you thought about?
[01:05] And like, how did you pick that one?
[01:07] And like, what was that decision process?
[01:09] I wanna know target market.
[01:11] Like, I feel like you nailed the target market.
[01:12] You've nailed the value prop.
[01:14] Were there three other runner-ups
[01:15] that you consider that you didn't have?
[01:17] I kinda wanna see what goes on underneath the surface
[01:20] before this beautiful execution comes out.
[01:23] Well, first, thanks.
[01:25] You hopefully only see the good stuff.
[01:27] Obviously, there's all types of bad shit
[01:29] that happens on the backend where we're like,
[01:31] the sucks, but in general, it's been quite pleasant.
[01:34] So, dude, with this company, it's so funny.
[01:37] I purposely had on, we had guests that ran
[01:40] these types of companies.
[01:41] And I wanted to prove to everyone,
[01:43] I'm gonna do my research in front of people.
[01:46] You left a paper trail, right?
[01:48] Like, you left public breadcrumbs
[01:51] as to exactly how you did this step by step.
[01:53] And by the way, I love that you're honest about this
[01:55] because you definitely had guests come on
[01:57] and basically explain to you what the blueprint is.
[02:00] And then you were like, cool, thanks.
[02:02] Gonna go execute on that blueprint.
[02:05] And I didn't hide it from them.
[02:07] I told them, I told them before and after,
[02:09] I wanna launch, I wanna launch,
[02:10] I'm thinking of launching something like this
[02:11] and let's talk about it.
[02:12] So, there was nothing unethical or evil about this,
[02:15] but yeah, I wanted to do it publicly so people could see.
[02:18] So, let me tell you first.
[02:19] So, I sold the hustle, I think in 22, yeah.
[02:24] And, or something like that.
[02:26] And I had about six months or eight months
[02:28] or 10 months I forget where I was just kind of fooling around
[02:31] and I was looking at different ideas.
[02:33] The two ideas that lost, I'm so thankful they lost.
[02:36] One, remember how I got super into Airbnb's?
[02:38] I was like, this is the thing, I could do this.
[02:40] So, I bought one and I did it.
[02:42] And I did okay, but I was like, this sucks.
[02:44] I do not enjoy this.
[02:46] This is it in my zone of genius.
[02:47] It's a pain in the ass.
[02:48] And it seems on paper like a good idea.
[02:51] You had a, you created this Facebook group of,
[02:53] I forgot what you called it, like Sam's
[02:54] short term rental bros or whatever the hell you call it.
[02:57] It was an SDR crew, the SDR crew, short term rental crew.
[03:00] And people piled in and they started explaining
[03:02] their blueprint to like, yo, I own 40 Airbnb's.
[03:05] They make this much cash flow.
[03:06] Here's the pain points, here's the plus sides.
[03:09] This other guy's like, oh, I do the same thing with this angle.
[03:11] And I was like, dude, this is fascinating.
[03:13] Sam's doing his research again in public.
[03:16] And if you were wandering around the IDMAs,
[03:18] you're like, maybe it's over here.
[03:19] Maybe the exit path is over here in this short term rental
[03:22] thing.
[03:23] And it kind of seemed like a good idea on paper,
[03:26] but you ended up saying no to that.
[03:27] And it was a good idea.
[03:28] It wasn't a good idea for me.
[03:29] It is a profitable thing, whatever.
[03:31] It was cool.
[03:31] The second thing that I thought about doing was,
[03:33] I thought about creating, I've always wanted to create
[03:35] a trucking business.
[03:36] I'm passionate about truckers.
[03:37] I'm passionate about blue collar workers.
[03:39] My family, I grew up in a trucking family.
[03:40] So I'm like, they're working that industry.
[03:43] And so I was like, I'm gonna become a YouTuber
[03:45] and I'm gonna create an audience of truckers.
[03:48] And then I'm gonna build a product for them.
[03:49] And then I started doing it and I was like,
[03:51] now, hate this, not gonna do it.
[03:54] You're like, I love the idea of blue collar workers.
[03:57] Yeah.
[03:58] I like the idea of it being a monk's dad.
[04:00] Yeah.
[04:01] Yeah, it's like getting a neck tattoo.
[04:02] It's like the idea of it's kind of neat,
[04:04] but I don't know if I actually want it.
[04:06] And so then I was like, look, we had this thing called
[04:08] Trends at the hustle and I got a lot wrong.
[04:10] And I love the business model still.
[04:12] I think I can do this.
[04:13] And my partner, my now business partner,
[04:15] we had like basically a therapy group
[04:18] where we would like bitching to play
[04:19] about everything going on.
[04:19] And we're like, I settled on that product.
[04:21] You built a product, launched it, did not use
[04:24] your audience initially publicly.
[04:26] You didn't use the podcast to promote it initially.
[04:28] Maybe your brand name helped, partly private,
[04:31] but you didn't do it publicly.
[04:33] And you drove it to millions of dollars in revenue
[04:37] very early on.
[04:37] So very successful thing that everybody
[04:40] lists his podcast kind of wants that outcome.
[04:42] So you know, you're a walking case study.
[04:44] Go ahead.
[04:45] Yeah. So Hampton is a peer group.
[04:47] So some people call it a community.
[04:48] I call it a peer group.
[04:49] Basically there's three parts of the peer group.
[04:52] So you have an eight person group
[04:53] that have similar size or types of companies.
[04:57] And you basically, it's like a therapy group.
[04:58] You just complain.
[04:59] So it takes about six months
[05:00] to really like forward to like catch and be awesome.
[05:03] But I have a six person or eight person group.
[05:05] It's freaking awesome.
[05:06] And you will do everything like you.
[05:08] Someone will make a presentation for every meeting
[05:10] and they'll say like, here's my portfolio.
[05:12] Here's my net worth.
[05:13] Can you guys tell me am I doing something
[05:14] or am I doing something right?
[05:15] Here's how my company works.
[05:16] What am I doing wrong?
[05:17] What am I doing right?
[05:18] And so they do a presentation.
[05:19] So that's part one.
[05:19] Part two is we have a digital community
[05:21] where you can like post in there
[05:23] and see what other people are saying.
[05:24] And you'd like, hey, I'm trying to hire Nanny.
[05:27] What are your guys' best advice for agencies
[05:30] to use in the Northeast?
[05:31] Things like that.
[05:32] You can do personal stuff, non-personal stuff.
[05:33] The third thing is events.
[05:34] I think we host 200 events a year at this point,
[05:37] including retreats, all these types of things.
[05:38] So it's highly inspired by chief,
[05:41] YPO, Vistage, these are large companies
[05:43] that are in the space.
[05:44] So that's the business.
[05:46] Originally, I was trying to go after marketing executives
[05:49] and then just executives in general.
[05:51] Dude, I called, I did 50 to 70 meetings
[05:54] with people trying to convince them to join.
[05:58] And none of them wanted it.
[06:00] Hello, dear marketing executive.
[06:02] Yeah, anyway.
[06:03] So it goes your marketing today.
[06:05] No one fucking wanted it.
[06:07] I couldn't get it.
[06:07] And then eventually I was like,
[06:09] I need to charge around 10 grand a year
[06:11] in order to make this a viable business.
[06:13] No one fucking wanted it.
[06:15] They're willing to pay $500.
[06:16] And I created a group that was actually $500.
[06:18] And I was like, dude, this sucks.
[06:19] I can't do this.
[06:21] And then we were like, should we do doctors?
[06:24] Doctors would be cool.
[06:26] But what the fuck?
[06:27] I don't know anything about doctors.
[06:28] I try to get in touch with the sun
[06:30] and no one wanted it.
[06:31] And then I was like, Fortune 500 CEOs.
[06:34] Same problem.
[06:35] How do I get in touch with the Fortune 500 CEO?
[06:37] Like I don't know one.
[06:39] Like it is really hard.
[06:40] And then I did it with the salary on the paper.
[06:43] But as soon as they came into contact with reality,
[06:45] they got punched in the face.
[06:47] And they ran out the nose.
[06:48] They got punched in the face.
[06:49] Well, this one really punched me in the face.
[06:51] The next one we thought about minorities.
[06:52] We're like, my wife is a minority.
[06:55] And I hear a little bit of the things that she goes through.
[06:58] I'm like, I should create this.
[06:59] And then I looked in the mirror.
[07:00] And I was like, yeah, this ain't gonna work.
[07:03] I'm the opposite of a minority.
[07:05] This is my look great on paper.
[07:07] But yeah, the old reflection.
[07:09] It doesn't look in the mirror.
[07:10] Yeah.
[07:11] I remember when you told me that idea.
[07:12] And I was like, dude, honestly, it's a great idea.
[07:15] I think it's a underserved community.
[07:17] I think they want that career development.
[07:19] I think that makes sense.
[07:21] But I was like, dude, what are you gonna do when you're like,
[07:24] hey, I was like, you know, are you gonna have Sarah be the CEO?
[07:29] Like, what are you gonna do?
[07:30] You're gonna be like, I am this white man
[07:32] who is running this guy back.
[07:34] I don't know, you're possible.
[07:36] But like, I don't know.
[07:38] If you Google the word white bread,
[07:40] you're gonna see a picture of Sam Parr.
[07:41] Like it would not have worked.
[07:43] There's a reason your nickname is the vanilla gorilla.
[07:46] Okay.
[07:46] Like, one gonna work.
[07:49] And then my partner was like, dude,
[07:50] let's just go out to CEO.
[07:51] So he'd been saying this whole time.
[07:52] I'm like, they will never pay for this.
[07:54] But all along, some people had heard rumors
[07:56] that I was launching this.
[07:57] So they asked me, like, can you do this for us?
[07:59] And I kept saying no.
[08:00] And then finally, we were like, fuck it.
[08:01] Let's do it.
[08:01] And then that obviously was the right decision.
[08:04] But by the way, I did a ton of research.
[08:06] So I interviewed a ton of members
[08:07] of all these different groups.
[08:08] And they're like, I'm a tech guy,
[08:10] but it's all like guys who own like 18 apartment buildings
[08:12] in South Florida in my group.
[08:14] It kind of sucks.
[08:14] I love them, but we don't like a line on business.
[08:16] Well, it just sounds like it's better founder fit, right?
[08:19] Like, yo, it's a true war.
[08:20] Yeah, no, no, no.
[08:21] It's who our audience is on this podcast.
[08:22] It's where you had a reputation.
[08:23] It's where you knew the relatable pain points.
[08:26] It's you knew how to, you knew where to reach him
[08:28] because you knew where you hang out.
[08:29] It's like way better founder fit.
[08:30] It was so much easier.
[08:31] It was way easier.
[08:32] All right, everyone, a quick break to tell you about HubSpot.
[08:35] And this one's really easy for me to talk about
[08:37] because I'm going to show you a real life example.
[08:38] So I've got this company called Hampton.
[08:40] Join Hampton.com.
[08:41] It's a community for founders doing
[08:42] between two million all the way up to like $250 million
[08:44] a year in revenue.
[08:45] And one of the ways that we've grown
[08:46] is we've created these cool surveys.
[08:48] And so we have a lot of founders who have high net worth.
[08:51] And we'll ask them all types of questions
[08:52] that people typically are embarrassed to ask,
[08:54] but provide a lot of value.
[08:55] So things like how much the founders paid themselves
[08:57] each month, how much money they're spending each month,
[08:59] what their payroll looks like.
[09:01] If they're optimistic about the next year
[09:03] and their business, all these questions
[09:04] that people are afraid to ask, but well,
[09:06] we ask them anyway.
[09:07] And they tell us in this anonymous survey.
[09:09] And so what we do is we created a landing page
[09:10] using HubSpot's landing page tool.
[09:12] And it basically has a landing page that says,
[09:14] here's all the questions we asked.
[09:16] Give us your email if you want to access it.
[09:18] And then I shared this page on Twitter.
[09:19] And we were able to get thousands of people
[09:21] who gave us their email and told us they want this survey.
[09:23] And I could see, did they come from social media?
[09:26] I can see did they come from Twitter from LinkedIn.
[09:28] It basically everywhere else
[09:29] that they could possibly come from,
[09:30] I'm able to track all of that.
[09:32] And then I'm able to see over the next handful of the weeks,
[09:34] how many of those people actually signed up
[09:36] and became a member of Hampton.
[09:38] In other words, I can see how much revenue came
[09:40] from this survey, how much revenue came from each
[09:42] traffic source, things like that.
[09:43] But the best part is I can see how much revenue came from it.
[09:46] And a lot of times it takes a ton of work to make that happen.
[09:49] HubSpot made that super, super easy.
[09:51] If you're interested in doing this,
[09:52] you can check it out hubspot.com,
[09:54] the links in the description.
[09:55] And I'll also put the link to the survey that I did
[09:57] so you can actually see the landing page
[09:58] and how it worked and everything like that.
[10:00] I'm just going to do that call to action then.
[10:03] And it's free.
[10:04] Check it out in the description.
[10:06] All right, now back to MFM.
[10:07] Now let's talk about the names.
[10:09] Here's a good story about the names.
[10:11] So the company's called Hampton.
[10:12] A lot of people think that means the Hamptons.
[10:14] Up until I was like 27, I didn't know what the Hamptons were.
[10:18] I thought I had read about it and like the great Gatsby.
[10:20] I thought like it was like that.
[10:22] I didn't even know what it was
[10:22] until I married a woman from that area
[10:24] and I learned about it.
[10:25] So what I do is all of my LLCs are named after streets
[10:29] in my neighborhood of St. Louis.
[10:32] And there's a lot of really good names for some reason.
[10:34] And so I just usually look at the map of where I'm from
[10:37] and I just look at the names.
[10:39] So let me tell you some names that I thought about naming it.
[10:41] None of these really fit, but they could fit for other things.
[10:43] Number one is Maclin.
[10:45] I love that name.
[10:46] Maclin.
[10:46] So at one point I thought about having the Maclin running club.
[10:49] The second one is Sibleb.
[10:50] I've always liked Sibleb.
[10:53] The third one was Simpson.
[10:55] That was a street I grew up near.
[10:57] And then the last one, check this out.
[10:59] Kings Highway.
[11:00] This Kings Highway also, I love Kings Highway.
[11:04] I love Kings Highway.
[11:05] And then eventually we settle about Hampton
[11:07] because I grew up near Hampton Avenue
[11:09] and everyone thinks that it means the Hamptons.
[11:12] It doesn't.
[11:12] It means Hampton.
[11:13] And so sometimes people will say like,
[11:14] oh, I love the Hamptons referring to my company
[11:16] and I'm like, no, it's Hampton.
[11:17] So we settled on Hampton because I had a good sound to it.
[11:20] By the way, can you tell me in deciding a name,
[11:23] is that like a one day process,
[11:26] a one hour process, a one month process for you
[11:28] and are you bouncing it off people
[11:30] or are you just going into a dark room
[11:31] and saying what feels right in my soul?
[11:33] Like what's your, what is the actual way a name gets picked for you?
[11:36] I only ask like three people.
[11:38] Usually it's my wife, my business partner, and that's about it.
[11:40] Three people, but actually there's only two.
[11:43] Even better.
[11:44] Did I just name two?
[11:46] In myself.
[11:47] The Royale Wii.
[11:48] Yeah.
[11:49] No, I don't really ask too many people
[11:50] because I just don't care that much.
[11:52] Like I just want to like hear someone's gut opinion.
[11:55] But and also hampton.com, I don't think I'm ever going to get.
[11:58] You know who it owns that is Mary-O.
[12:01] Yeah, the Hampton and yeah.
[12:03] So I don't know if I'm ever going to get that,
[12:04] but check this out with branding.
[12:05] If you asked me about this five or 10 years ago,
[12:07] I'd never have a million years thought this was important,
[12:09] but I actually do.
[12:10] I hired a branding agency.
[12:12] So I paid $15,000 right out the gate
[12:15] and what I did was and I sent this to you,
[12:17] I created this document and it says,
[12:20] it just says one line.
[12:21] It says elite but cheeky.
[12:23] And the reason I was inspired by that was,
[12:25] have you read Felix Dennis' book?
[12:27] Yes.
[12:28] How to get rich.
[12:29] So Felix Dennis is this famous entrepreneur.
[12:31] He's dead now, but he was a wild guy.
[12:34] He was basically a combination of Richard Branson and Mick Jagger.
[12:37] So he had like swagger, but he was like a legit business guy.
[12:40] But he was like, he was like elite in that.
[12:42] He was great at what he does,
[12:43] but he was like a silly person and he wrote
[12:46] in a very conversational way.
[12:47] And I love that.
[12:48] And so when I wrote out this branding document,
[12:50] I listed what the business is, who uses it, whatever.
[12:53] And then what I did was I listed a ton of ads that I liked.
[12:57] So there's a bunch of advertisements from the 70s.
[13:00] That's one of my favorite errors for ads.
[13:02] And I found a bunch of GQ ads, Porsche ads, and Rolex ads.
[13:06] Like Rolex had this famous series of ads
[13:09] called The Men Who Built the World Wear Rolex.
[13:12] And they would do like a really cool expose on like an astronaut.
[13:15] And you can see they asked you not he's wearing a Rolex or Dwight Eisenhower,
[13:18] the president of the United States.
[13:20] He's got a Rolex and it's the men who build America are wearing a Rolex.
[13:24] And then there's one with a Wall Street Journal
[13:26] where it says, money talks, we translate.
[13:28] And it's just this beautiful imagery.
[13:30] And so I took that imagery and then I took the color British racing green.
[13:34] You know what British racing green is?
[13:35] I mean, it's the Hampton colors, but it's like a famous color
[13:38] from like Land Rover and Jaguar.
[13:40] It's like these British racing colors that I love.
[13:44] And I thought that because like when I think of a Land Rover or Range Rover or Jaguar,
[13:47] what do you got there?
[13:49] There you go.
[13:51] That's almost so I freaking love that color.
[13:54] That's my favorite color.
[13:55] I've got motorcycles and that color.
[13:56] I've had a car in that color.
[13:57] It's my favorite color.
[13:58] And I took that color and I'm like, we have to make the brand feel like these ads,
[14:03] but be that color.
[14:04] And I wrote a bunch of sentences that I would want on the website.
[14:07] And that's how we selected the branding.
[14:09] And dude, hiring a branding agency is like a total hack.
[14:12] What are some things along the way of making Hampton that you could have done,
[14:17] but you said no to.
[14:19] And in retrospect, maybe it's a good idea about it.
[14:20] You don't know.
[14:21] You don't know how it would have turned out.
[14:22] But like, what were the nose up?
[14:24] Because we can only see what you said yes to.
[14:25] We could see the name you chose.
[14:27] We did you told us what the name you said no to?
[14:29] We could see the color you chose.
[14:31] What were the things you said no to along the way?
[14:33] Was there anything else that was like a pack you considered?
[14:36] Here's two really big ones.
[14:39] So Hampton gets, let's just say, these aren't the exact numbers,
[14:43] but we'll use them roughly 100 people a day who apply.
[14:47] We accept a fraction of that.
[14:49] And my partner, Joe and I, we watch, so in order to get into Hampton,
[14:53] you have to interview.
[14:54] We watch 100% of the interviews.
[14:57] And we are the only people who click a prover deny.
[15:00] That is it.
[15:01] It was us too.
[15:01] That is our job is to watch 100% of the interviews.
[15:04] So you said no to delegating that out?
[15:07] We said no to delegating that out.
[15:09] And we also, here's what sucks.
[15:12] Did we turn down so many people?
[15:14] And it's like we're turning down so much revenue.
[15:16] And it fucking kills me.
[15:18] I'm like adding up the numbers.
[15:20] When I, now when you ask me, so chief, cheap.com,
[15:23] it's like this business, I guess we're like them,
[15:26] but therefore women executives, you know why they grew so fast?
[15:29] They grew to 100 million in revenue in four or five years.
[15:32] They led in 100% of the people who apply in interview.
[15:36] We don't.
[15:37] And it fucking kills me.
[15:39] I see all this misrevenue.
[15:41] And I'm like, oh my God.
[15:42] And so I'm picking in my head.
[15:44] I'm like, so a lot of people, we've talked about those,
[15:46] but Kingsford charcoal was invented because Ford had all this
[15:50] extra wood that they used to like their furnaces
[15:52] and they eventually turn it to charcoal.
[15:54] That's how Kingsford charcoal came about.
[15:56] And so always in my head, I'm like, what's the charcoal I could make
[15:59] from these people who we've rejected?
[16:01] Or who don't fit our criteria at the moment?
[16:03] And but we've said no to doing any of those ideas.
[16:06] And so we're all what we said basically,
[16:07] we're only focusing on CEOs of this demographic,
[16:11] of this type of business.
[16:12] And we're only going to do that until we say otherwise.
[16:15] And there's no time in the near future
[16:17] that we intend to say otherwise.
[16:18] Well, let me tell you two things I think you could be doing.
[16:21] So can we give you two ideas?
[16:23] I think you maybe should have said yes to you.
[16:25] Number one, I think if I go to your website right now,
[16:29] I don't see that you say no to that many people
[16:32] or that there's a cure that how heavy the curation is.
[16:36] All the things you just said to me would make me want to join
[16:39] because it's like, oh, they're really actually curing
[16:40] the community.
[16:41] These are actually high quality people.
[16:42] The founders watch every single interview they let
[16:44] they accept it less than 1% of people.
[16:46] They have a counter on their website of how many people they've
[16:48] said no to or how many how much revenue they've said no to
[16:50] in order to make the community solid because that comes first.
[16:54] And we put our money where our mouth is,
[16:55] we turned down this much revenue.
[16:56] And maybe it's too vulgar, but I think you could use that.
[17:01] The second thing, you got the elite part right now,
[17:04] now we have to make it cheeky.
[17:05] Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[17:06] I just went to the lead douchey.
[17:08] So I don't know, we got to work on the other part.
[17:11] The other thing I don't think you did a great job of is your story.
[17:14] So like, do you value a founding story in like the founder story
[17:21] and the founding story of the company?
[17:22] Do you think that's important or useful?
[17:25] I think that's incredibly important.
[17:27] And I think I made a mistake because I wanted to make this
[17:29] not the Sam par business.
[17:31] And I think I screwed up.
[17:32] I think I should have leaned into that.
[17:34] I think the way it works, I did this with the hustle.
[17:37] You can, the founder can be the company or be the face
[17:39] for a period of time and you could phase it out.
[17:42] And with this time, I was like, I'm not going to be it.
[17:44] And I screwed that up.
[17:45] Yeah, yeah.
[17:46] I think you should lean into that because the,
[17:47] the, the situation is where you don't want the founder
[17:49] to be the, the, the face and the reason to join is when the founder
[17:52] has to deliver the service.
[17:54] It's like the law firm or the, the specialty, you know,
[17:57] marketing exec.
[17:58] It's like, oh, this guy's great.
[18:00] But oh, now I'm handed off to some junior person
[18:02] they're doing my marketing.
[18:02] I want that guy on my account.
[18:04] Whereas with this, you don't have to be the account.
[18:06] You know, you're not delivering the actual service.
[18:09] So I think you could use it because the true founding story
[18:11] is that's how we met.
[18:14] We made a peer group in San Francisco when we didn't know
[18:16] shit, when we were running our companies
[18:17] and there was, and it was a failure succeed.
[18:20] And in that group came a billion dollar company,
[18:24] a hundred million dollar company, a $30 million
[18:26] company, a two failures, but one best man at your wedding
[18:30] and a friend who ended up investing in their thing
[18:32] and that came out of that.
[18:33] And then this podcast came out of that, which then has become
[18:36] one of the top business podcasts, but what?
[18:38] Like that's actually almost like your founding story
[18:40] as an entrepreneur and helped you when you actually sold
[18:44] the hustle successfully.
[18:44] So from, I remember in our peer groups, it was like,
[18:48] I'm going to do the hustle.
[18:49] It was an events business.
[18:50] Then, no, no, next month, there was not an events business.
[18:53] It's a blog business.
[18:54] You said something that stuck with me and it was,
[18:56] it pissed you off.
[18:58] No, no, because you weren't wrong.
[19:00] You were right in that I couldn't build a huge company
[19:03] that way, but you were wrong in that I don't have to build
[19:06] a huge company in order to achieve my goals,
[19:08] which was you go, dude, you're showing up to this fight,
[19:11] you're showing up to this knife fight, which is a knife.
[19:14] I don't even want you to have a gun.
[19:15] You need to have a magic fucking wand.
[19:17] And I was like, well, you're not wrong.
[19:20] That would be nice to have that, but I don't.
[19:23] And so until that, we're used in our fists.
[19:25] And Silicon Valley, if you go pitch for investors,
[19:27] you're basically making a promise
[19:29] that it's going to be a billion dollar company.
[19:30] So I was like, I don't think it's going to be a billion dollar company.
[19:31] What I didn't know is you were like,
[19:33] I'm not trying to build a billion dollar company.
[19:34] I'm trying to build a company that makes me X millions of dollars
[19:38] and like, and I can do it.
[19:39] It can actually do that.
[19:40] And that would change my life and be fucking awesome,
[19:42] which is a different pitch.
[19:44] So you are right, but where I was wrong was,
[19:48] I shouldn't have aimed for that from the get go, but you are correct.
[19:52] But so I think maybe using a founding story
[19:54] would be helpful for you because it's genuine.
[19:57] That's actually the origin of I think a lot of this is like first hand
[20:00] experience, how the peer group helped you and how blah, blah.
[20:03] And then how it also leads to all these other thing that group became,
[20:06] you know, one guy's like, you know,
[20:08] a groom's miniature wedding, another guy becomes an investment.
[20:11] You make down the road, blah, blah, blah.
[20:13] That's kind of how these tend to work.
[20:15] So anyways, that's my two sets.
[20:16] Well, thank you.
[20:17] Did you have you ever used a braining agency?
[20:20] Have I used a guy for the milk road?
[20:23] Not I mean, he's an agency, but it's like a guy, one guy.
[20:27] Which I think you actually nailed.
[20:28] I think you nailed that to be honest.
[20:30] Yeah, I loved it.
[20:31] It was a cool experience.
[20:33] It definitely felt so indulgent.
[20:35] It's like, oh, and now I'm going to take a break
[20:37] from my zero revenue business to go through this
[20:41] mood boarding process with this designer and talk about
[20:44] how the brand needs to feel.
[20:46] It's like, it needs to feel like there's a user and a customer.
[20:50] And there's definitely a part of my voice that was like,
[20:52] shut up, shut up, you idiot.
[20:54] You go, go build your business.
[20:55] But what we did, the trade off we did was we actually with milk road,
[20:59] we wanted to do a brand right away.
[21:02] And we said, let's reward ourselves with a brand when we get to,
[21:05] I think we said 100,000 subscribers on the on the list.
[21:08] And I said, today we're going to make the brand.
[21:11] And but when we get to 100,000, then we'll know like this is,
[21:14] we can always rebrand and we can, we can polish it up.
[21:16] That's what we did to reward ourselves.
[21:18] I think in the future, I would probably use an agency
[21:21] if I'm confident about the idea.
[21:23] If I, it's also just like, I don't know,
[21:26] it's a luxury item.
[21:27] It's not a necessity, but it's a luxury.
[21:28] I think for something, it is a necessity.
[21:30] Like if you're a e-commerce brand or something,
[21:32] you've got to get your brand right.
[21:34] And you know another thing that I thought was a dumbest thing ever,
[21:36] but I think could be cool, a naming agency.
[21:39] I use the naming agency once.
[21:40] I find a lot of value in that now.
[21:42] I think that it's like most agencies where a lot will suck,
[21:45] but I actually think that could be quite valuable.
[21:47] What naming, how much is the naming agency?
[21:49] I hired it because this is one of my many rookie mistakes.
[21:52] I hired a naming agency once.
[21:53] I paid them $25,000.
[21:55] A lot of money.
[21:58] And they came in now.
[22:00] Let me tell you a couple of things about them.
[22:01] That's interesting.
[22:03] One, the people who work in a naming agency
[22:05] are actually awesome.
[22:07] Somebody who is drawn to that is a super interesting person.
[22:10] And actually the move is to go vet brand gategesys,
[22:13] or naming gategesys, and then just pluck
[22:15] the most interesting person you have.
[22:16] And be like, you're gonna run our whole brand.
[22:17] Come over, you just come in, house, you're gonna run our brand.
[22:19] That's what I should have done.
[22:20] And just the audacity that they think
[22:22] that they can just name something.
[22:24] They think that could be the job.
[22:26] 
[22:27] Who do you think you are?
[22:29] It's like, that's pretty.
[22:31] So they come in and there's three of them.
[22:33] I don't know if it takes three.
[22:34] So this is my God.
[22:36] And so they three of them come in and they sit down
[22:38] and they say, so tell me about the company.
[22:42] And when I tell you I've never felt
[22:43] as much pressure in a pitch,
[22:45] because I'm like, this isn't pitching
[22:46] for an investor or a customer.
[22:47] I'm like, I need to give these creatives,
[22:51] because creative people like that, they're very skeptical.
[22:52] You know, they see a bunch of corporate BS.
[22:54] It's like, I need to be cool and so clear.
[22:57] And I need to capture the essence inside this business.
[23:00] I can't just say the surface line.
[23:01] That's what they want.
[23:02] They were like, yeah, but what is it?
[23:05] And you're like, I just told you what it is.
[23:07] What do you mean, what is it?
[23:09] So anyways, I have this conversation with them.
[23:11] And then I'm like, I want to know this guy's process.
[23:14] And so I leave the room.
[23:15] He comes, I come back in.
[23:16] Mox amongst the weeds.
[23:17] He needs to read us.
[23:19] In the middle of the room,
[23:19] he's moved our table to the side.
[23:22] He's sitting in his cell with a floor.
[23:24] With a wipe, took our whiteboard, put it on the ground.
[23:27] And he's writing long sentences.
[23:29] And I'm like, this is not names.
[23:31] Like this is like paragraphs.
[23:32] What are you doing?
[23:34] And he's just writing out almost in first person.
[23:37] This was awesome.
[23:37] He's writing out in first person.
[23:39] I think we were doing a dating app at the time.
[23:41] So he was helping us with a dating app.
[23:43] He was just writing out like from first person
[23:45] almost venting as the customer.
[23:47] And he's like, I don't download a dating app.
[23:49] I download dating apps.
[23:50] All of them.
[23:51] Every single one of them.
[23:51] It's embarrassing.
[23:52] And he's like, I've tried them all.
[23:54] I use them all and I hate them all.
[23:56] But I use them.
[23:57] I hate to use them.
[23:58] And he's like, I hate them because it's mostly
[24:00] me sitting there sending out messages that are not getting
[24:04] replies.
[24:05] And I just, and then the next message I said, I know this is
[24:08] probably not going to reply.
[24:09] That's a pretty hopeless feeling.
[24:10] At least if I go to a girl at a bar, she rejects me to my face.
[24:14] Online cowards.
[24:15] These women are cowards.
[24:16] And he's like, they don't even apply.
[24:18] And so then he's just venting.
[24:20] And he's like, and he's scratching stuff out.
[24:21] Because he's like, no, that's not really true.
[24:22] But it was almost like slam poetry.
[24:24] It's like, he was trying to like, almost get into the feeling
[24:27] of the problem and then the solution.
[24:30] And he was, but he was doing it not in a business plan anyway.
[24:32] But I really actually liked that process.
[24:34] And I kind of hijacked that.
[24:36] So I paid a very expensive 25k to learn that one process,
[24:40] which is actually very useful as a copywriter to,
[24:43] to like get to the essence of like, what you're trying to do.
[24:46] The name ended up sucking.
[24:47] And like they did all these exercises where they would be like,
[24:50] they put out these flashcards that were like,
[24:52] Branson, Elon Musk, Einstein.
[24:55] They're like, pick, pick two that you think fit.
[24:57] And then they'd be like, Corvette Rolex, Louis Vuitton,
[25:01] blah, blah, pick two.
[25:02] And then I'm like, dude, what is this personality quiz?
[25:05] And I was just like, I hated the whole process.
[25:06] And then whatever the name was whatever it was.
[25:08] I don't even remember how to say the name.
[25:10] I don't even remember the name.
[25:11] I'm sorry, it's very unsatisfying ending to it.
[25:13] But how do you not remember the name that they picked?
[25:19] That's say, lovey.
[25:23] That's what you should've called the fucking app.
[25:25] The app like failed by the time they gave us the name.
[25:27] We were like, this is a stupid idea.
[25:29] We don't know how to do this.
[25:29] App, let's move on.
[25:31] I still think it's worth it, by the way.
[25:33] I still think it's worth it.
[25:34] I think that's a lot of money though.
[25:36] 25 grand is a lot.
[25:37] I think I paid my branding agency 15,000.
[25:40] Yeah, it's hard.
[25:41] When you, when she start to fall into that hole,
[25:43] you're like, well, do I want the best brand
[25:46] or just a mediocre brand?
[25:47] Like how much of my brand gonna be worth?
[25:50] Is it not worth an extra 5K?
[25:51] It's very hard to say no.
[25:53] Dude, at least for me.
[25:54] That's ridiculous.
[25:56] Is that the pod?
[25:56] Well, let's let's recap real quick.
[25:58] It took you, you did your research in public.
[26:01] It took you five false starts on figure out who is the customer
[26:05] and the way you did it was, you had an idea
[26:08] that sounded good in theory and then you went and tried
[26:10] to contact them and be like, do you want this?
[26:11] And then you got like punch to the face five times.
[26:14] And then one of them looked great,
[26:15] but then like no founder fit.
[26:16] And you settled on what was probably the obvious idea.
[26:19] So that's like the first takeaway.
[26:20] Second takeaway, your name is awesome.
[26:23] The name is awesome, but you use streets around you.
[26:25] Okay, I don't know if anyone else wants to copy that.
[26:26] Mine would be a grand floral boulevard,
[26:29] which I don't think is gonna make for a great startup name.
[26:31] No, San Francisco has a bunch of good names too.
[26:35] Well, that's why I used to live another kid.
[26:36] I think we should show the deck that you made
[26:39] for the branding agency.
[26:41] Because this is not what they gave you.
[26:42] This is what you gave them to get a good output.
[26:45] Because you garbage in, garbage out.
[26:47] If you give the bad instructions or bad prompt,
[26:49] you're gonna get a bad result on the brand.
[26:51] So I think that's cool to show.
[26:52] And I think maybe one other thing that I think people could
[26:55] take away is using a founder story.
[26:57] I think a founder story is very powerful.
[26:59] And I think I need to fix that.
[27:00] So I just got like $25,000 worth of advice for free.
[27:04] So that's good.
[27:05] I appreciate that.
[27:06] You got my Ben-Mont.
[27:09] All right, is that it?
[27:10] Is that the pod?
[27:10] That's it, that's the pod.
[27:27] What's up?
